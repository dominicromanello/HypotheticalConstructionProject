# Hypothetical Construction Project
Managed frontend and backend files to make a webpage for a hypothetical construction company to sort through their clients, bids, hires, managers, projects, and subcontractors

## Project Requirements
1. Written overview or summary of the project: its purpose, its functionality, any sort of user documentation, description of known problems, etc. This should be “deliverable” to a client (i.e. professional tone and writing.)
2. Final Conceptual E-R diagram (modified if necessary), correctly showing all attributes, cardinalities and participation constraints.
3. Logical E-R diagram, Table design, Relationships, & Data:
- The schema is correctly mapped from the Final Conceptual E-R diagram
- Primary and foreign keys are appropriately identified and assigned
- Attributes are an appropriate type and size
- The initial DDL includes the correct SQL syntax to create tables, and the initial insertion of data for each table is a separate transaction.
4. Supporting Queries and Functionality:
- At least 10 SQL queries are demonstrated that implement the functionality described in #1. These must include:
-- SELECT queries demonstrating: two-table join, three-table join, self-join, an aggregate function, an aggregate function using GROUP BY and HAVING, a textbased-search query using LIKE with wildcard(s), a subquery.
- One stored function, one stored procedure, and one trigger: implemented and demonstrated through an appropriate query.
- Make sure that these queries also demonstrate the intended functionality of the project 
5. A simple, web-based front-end providing links to the appropriate queries.
