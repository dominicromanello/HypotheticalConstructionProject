No primary keys are represented. A bid is probably an entity because it has a date, a description of work, an amount, etc. Client and Employee names should be shown as composite attributes. Client contact info would be stored. Project description and end date would be likely attributes of Project. Cost would probably be a derived attribute (sum of the Subcontractor bids).}
